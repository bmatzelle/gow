# .keep (README.md)

This is a placeholder file which forces the version control system to track and
store this otherwise empty directory.

## Why is this needed?

To function, `bash` currently requires the `etc` directory to exist within the GOW
directory structure. Without the `etc` directory, `bash` simply closes and returns
(see bmatzelle/gow#65, bmatzelle/gow#127, and bmatzelle/gow#180).
